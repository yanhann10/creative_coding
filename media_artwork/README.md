### Art Piece 1
![Borderless](images/borderless.jpg?raw=true "borderless")  

This is the first art piece that I like. Borderless is a light installation that reminds me to Thai lantern festival where thousands of lit lanterns rise and disappear into the night sky. 

I especially like the multiple parrallism between the similarly immmersive experiences â€“ a cultural practice turned into a touristy attraction, an artwork turned into an instagram opportunity.
