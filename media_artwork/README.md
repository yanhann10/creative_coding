### Art Piece 1

This is the first art piece that I like. Forest of Resonating Lamps is a light installation by teamLab at Mori Building Digital Art Museum in Tokyo. When a visitor stands next to a lamp, it emits color and resonates, spreading out to nearby lamps.

The Venetian-glass made lamps remind me of Thai lantern festival where thousands of lit lanterns rise and disappear into the night sky, together with the parrallism between the similarly immmersive experiences – a cultural practice turned into touristy attraction, an artwork turned into instagram opportunity. I like how it digitalized a naturally sublime scene, making the experience repeatable and responsive.

### Art Piece 2

This is the second art piece that I like – Mosaic Virus by artist Anna Ridler commissioned by Impakt Festival. In the AI-powered video artwork, the tulips bloom and wane according to bitcoin price. It transformed literally the comments of a Dutch banker who drew parallel between Bitcoin's bubbles with the historical event of 'tulip mania' where a virus caused the tumultuous rise and fall of tulip prices.
