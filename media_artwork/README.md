# Some examples of media artworks I like

### Art Piece 1

This is the first art piece that I like. Borderless is a light installation at Mori Building Digital Art Museum in Tokyo that reminds me to Thai lantern festival where thousands of lit lanterns rise and disappear into the night sky. 

I especially like the multiple parrallism between the similarly immmersive experiences – a cultural practice turned into touristy attraction, an artwork turned into instagram opportunity.

### Art Piece 2

This is the second art piece that I like – Mosaic Virus by Anna Ridler commissioned by Impakt Festival in Netherlands. The AI-powered video artwork drew inspiration from a Dutch banker's comment comparing Bitcoin to the historical event of 'tulip mania' that swept across Netherlands. The tulips bloom and wane according to bitcoin price.
