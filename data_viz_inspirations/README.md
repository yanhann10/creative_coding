### One Angry Bird

One Angry Bird by Periscopic examines the facial expressions of the last six presidents during the past 10 inaugural addresses. I find the featherly shape intriguing. Cold color tones and the upper side of feather were used to indicate happiness and surprise, while warm color tones and the lower side indicate negative emotions. The arc of the feather indicates overall positivity or negativity of the speech. This would have been a two-sided bar chart if without the feather, which made the visual a lot more memorable. As the visual is shaped by the data, the feather that looked the best is actually the most negative speech, which gives it a nice arc.

### Tree rings

Immigration Tree Rings was created by PEDRO M. CRUZ AND JOHN WIHBEY. I like the amoeba-like fluid shape, with immigrants of different origins plotted in dot density bounded by the rings of the tree that represent years. The canned chart equivalent would be a sunburst. But the nature of the topic doesn't necessarily call for the precision of encodings. For social or cultural topics, I feel charts can be more organic, because the end goal is to leave a general impression rather than to derive a metric such as percentage increase.

### Wind map

Wind Map created by Fernanda Vi√©gas and Martin Wattenberg and was exhibited in MOMA. The fur-like vectors of wind give an organic feel, making the map trustworthy and relatable at once.
